### Startup and memory

| Metric | onCrack |
|---|---|
| cold start: docker run → /up 200 (ms) | 298 |
| idle memory.current (MB) | 28.0 |
| idle anon (MB) | 15.0 |
| peak memory.current under load (MB) | 123 |
| peak anon under load (MB) | 102 |

### HTTP (signed in as david; keep-alive; c = concurrent connections)

`CPU µs/req` is the container's CPU (cgroup cpu.stat, user + system, unprofiled) over the run divided by its requests; for CPU a ratio below 1 means the first app spends more per request.

| Metric | onCrack |
|---|---|
| up c=1 req/s | 14,316 |
| up c=1 CPU µs/req | 123 |
| up c=1 p50 ms | 0.06 |
| up c=1 p99 ms | 0.10 |
| up c=16 req/s | 86,052 |
| up c=16 CPU µs/req | 22.9 |
| up c=16 p50 ms | 0.19 |
| up c=16 p99 ms | 0.29 |
| up c=64 req/s | 159,235 |
| up c=64 CPU µs/req | 16.3 |
| up c=64 p50 ms | 0.36 |
| up c=64 p99 ms | 1.24 |

## Validity

### Load average before each run (1, 5, 15 minutes; the run waited for the 1-minute figure to fall below LOAD_MAX)

| App | Rep | Before | After |
|---|---|---|---|
| onCrack | 1 | 1.38 2.86 2.75 | 4.51 3.25 2.89 |

### Host CPU probe (a fixed spin timed on every pinned CPU, against the quietest this VM has shown; bench/lib/hostprobe.py)

The VM's load average cannot see another program on the Mac taking the cores its vCPUs run on; this can. A ratio of 1.00 is a quiet host, above 1.10 the pinned server and load generator were slowed by something outside the run. `After each window` probes the machine right after every measured run of the rep.

| App | Rep | Before the run | After the run | Windows probed above 1.10 | Highest after a window |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| onCrack | 1 | 1.01 | 1.05 | 0/3 | 1.06 |

### Responses by status class, every HTTP run of every rep

| App | Route | 2xx | 3xx | 4xx | 5xx | Errors (no response) |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| onCrack | up | 2,077,185 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |

### Warm-up before each measured run (the app runs the route at the measured concurrency until its throughput is flat; bench/lib/warmup.py)

`measured / warm-up tail` is the measured run's requests a second over the mean of the last three 2 s warm-up windows: well above 1 would mean the app was still speeding up when measurement began, well below 1 that it was slowing down.

| App | Route | c | warm-up seconds | settled | measured / warm-up tail |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| onCrack | up | 1 | 30.0 | 1/1 | 0.96 |
| onCrack | up | 16 | 30.0 | 1/1 | 0.99 |
| onCrack | up | 64 | 40.0 | 1/1 | 1.00 |

### Rows written by `post_message` (messages of the write room counted in the app's SQLite file around each run)

| App | Rep | Phase | Posts answered below 400 | Rows written | Match |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|

### Response bytes, one request per route (gzip: wire / decoded; identity: bytes) and the average over the c=16 run

The probe is a single request after sign-in, before any load. Bodies carry per-request tokens and the clock, so sizes of two apps agree to within a few bytes when they render the same page. "c=16 avg" is what the load generator received per request on the wire (gzip unless the column says otherwise).

| Route | onCrack gzip wire / decoded | onCrack identity | onCrack c=16 avg | vs Rust |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| up | 200 90 / 73 | 200 73 | 90 | – |
| post_message | – | – | – | – |
